# Improvements

I think these are the few things can be improved,

## `Search with null date`

We can remove the date search and the system will fetch all data.

## `Tooltips`

A tool tip could be added to `+number`(To email) to have better visibility of the receivers email addresses.

## `Add multiple language with i18n`

We can add multi languages in UI using i18n

## `Show attached file in the subject column`

It is better visibility with attachment files

## `Not Found page`

`Not found page` will be displayed when the URL is not exactly
